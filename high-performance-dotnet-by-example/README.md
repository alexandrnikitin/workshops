# "High performance .NET by example"

In progress...

We have a feature in Adform that identifies unwanted bot traffic. It’s backed by the Aho–Corasick algorithm, a string searching algorithm that matches all strings simultaneously. We will discover the algorithm and its current implementation. We will learn how to write micro benchmarks, profile code and read assembly code. We will improve performance by 20-30 times by different techniques: re-implement BCL data structures, fix CPU cache misses, reduce main memory reads by putting values in CPU registers by force, avoid calls to Method table, evaluate .NET Core (try SIMD?)


This workshop consists of two parts: basics and hardcore.
The first one is a workshop. We will learn how to write micro benchmarks, profile code using different profiles. 
We will learn how to read IL and assembly code for saner understanding how our code works.
We will find main bottlenecks and optimize performance significantly.

The second part will be a demonstration. I'll show you how we can use different tools and improve performance by tens times using different optimization techniques.

### Domain:

All websites receive bot traffic. A study shows that bots drive 16% of Internet traffic in the US, in Singapore this number reaches 56%. 
Source http://news.solvemedia.com/post/32450539468/solve-media-the-bot-stops-here-infographic

Not all bots are bad, and some of them are vital for the Internet. 
White bots (good) search engines (Google, Bing), robot.txt
Grey bots (neutral) - don't bring clients directly, generate load. Frameworks, utilities,
Black bots (bad) - fraud, intentionaly fake impression, clicks, etc.

### Algorithm:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm
a string searching algorithm
accepts a finite set of strings we want to find
it matches all strings simultaneously
backed by a trie
additional "failure" collections between nodes

Lesson 0: First efficiency then performance



### Harness:

#### Microbenchmarks:

is hard!

DOs & DON'Ts from Microsoft:

- **DO** use a microbenchmark when you have an isolated piece of code whose performance you want to analyze.
- **DO NOT** use a microbenchmark for code that has non-deterministic dependences (e.g. network calls, file I/O etc.)
- **DO** run all performance testing against retail optimized builds.
- **DO** run many iterations of the code in question to filter out noise.
- **DO** minimize the effects of other applications on the performance of the microbenchmark by closing as many unnecessary applications as possible.
